# DevOps-Journey-in-FAST
As a student of the Foundation for Advancement of Science and Technology â€” National University (FAST-NU), I had the privilege of taking a DevOps course under the guidance of Sir Saim Safdar. Sir Saim is not just an academician, but an industry professional with a wealth of knowledge and experience in DevOps. His approach to teaching is unique, as he encourages us to learn in public, a strategy that has the potential to attract many industry recruiters.

The DevOps Toolkit
Our journey began with an introduction to the DevOps toolkit, a set of industry-leading tools that are essential for any DevOps professional. These tools included GitHub, Docker, Docker Compose, Podman, Kaniko, Kubernetes, and Cosign. Each of these tools has its own unique features and capabilities, and learning how to use them effectively was a key part of our course.

GitHub
GitHub was our primary tool for version control. It allowed us to collaborate on projects, track changes, and maintain a history of our work. We learned how to create repositories, make commits, and manage branches, among other things.

Docker and Docker Compose
Docker was another crucial tool in our DevOps toolkit. It allowed us to create, deploy, and manage containers, which are lightweight, standalone, executable packages that include everything needed to run a piece of software. Docker Compose, on the other hand, is a tool for defining and managing multi-container Docker applications.

Podman and Kaniko
Podman is a daemonless container engine for developing, managing, and running OCI Containers on your Linux System. It gave us the ability to manage pods, containers, and container images. We also learned about Kaniko, a tool to build container images from a Dockerfile, inside a container or Kubernetes cluster.

Kubernetes
Kubernetes, also known as K8s, is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It groups containers that make up an application into logical units for easy management and discovery.

Cosign
Cosign is a tool for signing and verifying container images, which is crucial for security in a DevOps environment. We learned how to use Cosign to sign our container images, verify their signatures, and ensure their integrity.

Advanced Topics: Istio and Service Mesh
In addition to these tools, Sir Saim also directed us towards learning about service mesh technology, specifically Istio. Istio is an open-source service mesh that provides a way to control how different parts of an application share data with one another. We even completed a certification on the Fundamentals of Istio, which was incredibly helpful.

Learning in Public
One of the most valuable lessons Sir Saim taught us was the importance of learning in public. He encouraged us to share our learning journey, our projects, and our experiences with the wider community. This not only helped us solidify our understanding of the material, but also attracted the attention of many industry recruiters.

Applying Our Knowledge
Throughout the course, we had the opportunity to apply our knowledge in practical ways. We worked on various projects, each of which required us to use the tools and techniques we had learned. Here are a few examples of the projects we worked on:

Advanced Kubernetes Networking
In one project, we explored advanced Kubernetes networking concepts, including Ingress, Network Policies, and Service Meshes. We learned how to configure Ingress to manage external access to the services in a cluster, how to use Network Policies to control traffic flow at the IP address or port level, and how to use Service Meshes to manage service-to-service communication in a complex microservices architecture. You can read more about this project in this Medium article by me.

Securing Containers with Cosign and Distroless Images
Security is paramount in the world of containerization. In another project, we learned how to secure our containerized applications using Cosign and Distroless images. Cosign is a tool for signing and verifying container images, while Distroless images allow us to minimize the attack surface of our containers by including only the application and its runtime dependencies. You can read more about this project in this Medium article by me.

Creating a Simple HTTP Server in Google Cloud
In another project, we learned how to create a simple HTTP server in Google Cloud. This project allowed us to gain hands-on experience with cloud computing, a key component of modern DevOps practices. You can read more about this project in this Medium article by me.

Dockerizing a React Application
Finally, we learned how to Dockerize a React application. This project allowed us to gain practical experience with Docker, one of the most important tools in the DevOps toolkit. You can read more about this project in this Medium article by me.

A Journey of Learning and Growth
Looking back, I can confidently say that my DevOps journey at FAST-NU under the guidance of Sir Saim Safdar was a journey of learning and growth. I learned not only about the technical aspects of DevOps, but also about the importance of learning in public, sharing my knowledge with others, and attracting the attention of industry recruiters.

I am grateful to Sir Saim for his guidance and mentorship. His industry experience and practical approach to teaching made the course engaging and informative. His encouragement to learn in public has opened up new opportunities for me, and I am excited to continue my DevOps journey.

As I look forward to the future, I am excited to apply the skills and knowledge I have gained in the real world. I am confident that the tools and techniques I have learned will serve me well in my career as a DevOps professional.

Thank you, Sir Saim, for guiding us on this journey. Your teachings will continue to inspire us as we navigate our careers in the ever-evolving world of DevOps.
